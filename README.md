<h1> Mini Challenge </h1>
	Write a function which takes a single integral value and prints out a spiral to standard output. The input value indicates the size of the grid to create the spiral in. Passing in 5 would result in a spiral generated in a 5x5 grid. The spiral should start on the top left most cell and each edge should be one unit shorter as the spiral winds around and finally ends.
